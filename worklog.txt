- Organized data preprocessing into one file. See preprocessing file for specifics
- Trained own fcn and saved model. (not so good, but meh)
- Created a visualization file for mapping predictions back to rgb and displaying it.

modified My_FCNN. made too many changes so i started a new file, called fcn-mod.ipynb. 
the file loaded data, mapped the rgb channel to pixels, and resized images. Then fed the data into the same fcnn from My_FCNN.ipynb.
The dimensions are ok and the model was running; but then colab crashed before i could see results. It said I didn't have enough ram.

looked at docs and tried to use deeplab on pascal VOC dataset
also did fnc but it wasn't very impressive at all. look on the official docs page and you might be able to do better than i did
